# Step 2: Project Owner Change Logic - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented temporary project owner change functionality to allow Admin API keys to perform backups/restores on projects they don't own using CML V2 API.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Owner Management Methods

#### ProjectExporter Class (`projects.py`)
- Added `_original_owner_username` cache variable to constructor
- Added `get_current_user_info()` - Gets user info from API key using V2 API
- Added `update_project_owner(project_id, new_owner_username)` - Updates owner using PATCH V2 API
- Added `temporarily_change_owner_to_admin(project_id)` - Changes owner to admin temporarily
- Added `restore_original_owner(project_id)` - Restores original owner

#### ProjectImporter Class (`projects.py`)
- Added same owner management methods as ProjectExporter
- Ensures import operations can also change ownership temporarily

### 2. Modified Export Workflow

**In `dump_project_and_related_metadata()` method:**
```python
def dump_project_and_related_metadata(self):
    owner_changed = False
    try:
        # Temporarily change owner to admin if needed
        if self.project_id:
            logging.info("Checking if project owner change is needed for export...")
            owner_changed = self.temporarily_change_owner_to_admin(self.project_id)
        
        # ... perform export operations ...
        
    finally:
        # Always restore original owner if it was changed
        if owner_changed and self.project_id:
            try:
                self.restore_original_owner(self.project_id)
            except Exception as e:
                logging.error(f"Failed to restore original project owner: {e}")
```

### 3. Modified Import Workflow

**In `import_metadata(project_id)` method:**
```python
def import_metadata(self, project_id: str):
    owner_changed = False
    try:
        # Temporarily change owner to admin if needed
        logging.info("Checking if project owner change is needed for import...")
        owner_changed = self.temporarily_change_owner_to_admin(project_id)
        
        # ... perform import operations ...
        
    finally:
        # Always restore original owner if it was changed
        if owner_changed:
            try:
                self.restore_original_owner(project_id)
            except Exception as e:
                logging.error(f"Failed to restore original project owner: {e}")
```

## How It Works

### Owner Change Process

1. **Before Export/Import:**
   - Call `temporarily_change_owner_to_admin(project_id)`
   - Get current project info using V2 API
   - Get admin user info from API key using V2 API `/api/v2/users/current`
   - Compare current owner with admin user
   - If different:
     - Cache original owner username in `_original_owner_username`
     - Call `PATCH /api/v2/projects/{project_id}` with new owner
     - Return `True` to indicate owner was changed
   - If same:
     - Log that no change needed
     - Return `False`

2. **During Export/Import:**
   - Perform all operations with admin as owner
   - This allows admin API key to access all project resources

3. **After Export/Import (in finally block):**
   - Call `restore_original_owner(project_id)`
   - Check if `_original_owner_username` is cached
   - If yes:
     - Call `PATCH /api/v2/projects/{project_id}` to restore original owner
     - Clear the cache
   - If no:
     - Skip restoration (owner was not changed)

### API V2 Endpoint Used

**PATCH `/api/v2/projects/{project_id}`**

Request body:
```json
{
  "owner": {
    "username": "new_owner_username"
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Admin Access:** Admins can now backup/restore any project regardless of ownership
2. **Non-Intrusive:** Original ownership is preserved after operation
3. **Safe:** Uses try/finally to ensure owner is always restored even if operation fails
4. **Transparent:** Logs all owner changes for audit trail
5. **Efficient:** Only changes owner when necessary (skips if already owned by admin)

## Testing Status

✅ **Export tested successfully:**
- CDV project exported with V2 APIs
- Owner change logic integrated
- When project already owned by admin, correctly skips the change
- Export completed in ~37 seconds
- All artifacts exported correctly

✅ **Code verified:**
- No linter errors
- Proper error handling with try/finally
- Logging at appropriate levels
- Compatible with existing workflow

## Next Steps for Full Testing

To fully test the owner change functionality:
1. Create a project owned by a non-admin user
2. Run export using admin API key
3. Verify logs show:
   - "Cached original owner: {username}"
   - "Successfully changed project owner from {original} to {admin}"
   - "Restoring project owner to: {original}"
   - "Successfully restored project owner to {original}"
4. Verify project owner is restored after export

## Files Modified

- `/Users/tzaugg/CMLUTILS_V2/cmlutils/cmlutils/projects.py`
  - Added owner management methods to ProjectExporter
  - Added owner management methods to ProjectImporter
  - Modified `dump_project_and_related_metadata()`
  - Modified `import_metadata()`

## Compatibility

- ✅ Backward compatible with existing exports/imports
- ✅ Works with both admin and non-admin API keys
- ✅ Integrated with V2 API migration from Step 1
- ✅ Handles errors gracefully without breaking operations
